#=====================Constants======================
#	What are constants?
#		Constants are variables that never change
#	throughout the project's runtime.  Use-cases for
#	constants are somewhat limited, but in this game
#	we used constants for the game window size and
#	a few of the messages that appear on screen.
#
#	#===Numbers===#
#	WIDTH 	= game window width
#	HEIGHT 	= game window height
#
#	#===Messages===#
#	START_MESSAGE 			= message for beginning game
#	RESTART_MESSAGE 		= message for resetting game
#	CURRENT_SCORE_MESSAGE 	= message to help display the score
#	HIGH_SCORE_MESSAGE 		= message to help display the high score
#	NEW_HIGH_SCORE_MESSAGE 	= displays when new high score is reached

#======================Variables=====================
#	What are variables?
#		Variables are values stored in the program that
#	can change.  There are many types of variables, and
#	the simplest ones include strings for words and
#	ints/floats for numbers.  Constants also use these "data-types"
#
#	#===Objects===#
#	player = this variable will hold our player object
#	pipes[] = this variable will store a list of our pipe objects
#	
#	#===Numbers===#
#	score = stores the current score for the game
#	high_score = stores the high score for the current instance of the game
#
#	#===Booleans===#
#	scene_initialized 	= used to initialize the scene for the first run of the
#                         game and for every time the game resets.
#	player_ready 		= used to determine if the player object is ready for inputs
#	spawner_started 	= used to start spawning pipes

#	you draw it last.  At the start of every draw we
#	clear the screen.

#==============================Update Function========================================
# Description:
#		This function is used to update the scene of the game.
#
#
#	What is a scene?
#		The scene is basically just the environment our game/gamestate takes place in.
#	Our game just has one scene, but many games have several scenes. Something such as
#	a new level or a seperate menu screen could be considered a scene.
#
#	Update Function Logic:
#		The main thing controlling the state of our scene are booleans that determine
#	what is happening in the game.  Our booleans that are relevant check if the scene
#	is initialized (scene_initialized), if the player is ready (player_ready), if the
#	player has lost (player.has_lost), and if the spawner was started.
#
#	A) Every time we start or restart the game, we reinitialize it with the first if
#		statement.  Within the first if statement we also start the spawner for the
#		duration of the games runtime.
#
#	B) We run the player update function from the class
#
#	C) We update the pipes
#
#	D) Gamestate actions, we check if the player earns points or loses
#
#=====================================================================================
def update():
    #We need to call these global variables whenever we want to modify them
    #In normal programs its best to avoid having too many global variables,
    #however, since this game is a single file the globals are fine for now
    global scene_initialized
    global spawner_started
    global player_ready
    global score

        pipes.clear()
            
        #start the spawner if it hasn't been started
        if not spawner_started:

        score = 0

    #	then we run the player.update() function from our class

#=============Check Collision Function===============
# Description:
#		This function checks whether the player has
#	collided with a pipe.  If they have then we
#	change the state inside the player object for
#	our boolean "player.has_lost" to true.  There are
#	extra checks for if the player goes to high, or
#	for if they hit the ground.
#
#		Additionally, there is a check for if the
#	player sets a high score once it's determined
#	they've lost.
#====================================================
